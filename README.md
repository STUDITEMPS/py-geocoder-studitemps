## Geocoder Python

### Requirements

install  the dependencies using the command bellow:

    pip install -r requirements.txt

### Usage

You will need to create an application in Auth0 or use an existing one.
The environment variables in `.env.example` must be set for authenticatation to work.
They are

```bash
export GEOCODER_HOST="<GEOCODER_HOST>"
export AUTH0_CLIENT_ID="<AUTH0_CLIENT_ID>"
export AUTH0_CLIENT_SECRET="<AUTH0_ZERO_CLIENT_SECRET>"
export AUTH0_SITE="<AUTH0_SITE>"
export AUTH0_AUDIENCE="<AUTH0_AUDIENCE>"
```

```python

# get geocoordinates for an address
from geocoder_studitemps import (
    Geocoder,
    Address,
    settings
)

# this will create and validate the format of an address, using 
# the google i18 address api. see: https://chromium-i18n.appspot.com/ssl-address
address = Address(street="Im Mediapark 4a", postal_code="50670", city="KÃ¶ln")

# We can also attempt to validate the address if we want to using the i18address API
# This can fail and will raise an InvalidAddress exception
address.validate()

# Now create a Geocoder instance. In general there are two flows
# 1) you can use an existing auth0 token (perhaps you have cached it)
# 2) Directly authenticate with auth0, get a new token and use that one.
# This example shows the second approach

g = Geocoder(settings)

# now authenticate and store the auth_token inside the Geocoder instance
# If authentication fails and exception will be raised.
g.authenticate()

# now we can make geocoding API calls

# get long/lat values
res = geocoder.coordinates(address)
print(res) # Geopoint(latitude=50.94832, longitude=6.9454159)

# if you enter an address that doesn't exist or can't be found, 
# then currently None is returned and an Exception will not be raised.
```
